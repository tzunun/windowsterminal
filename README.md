# windowsterminal
Changing the windows terminal colorscheme from the WSL command line.


The only changes I have made is renamed the Solarized Dark theme to Solarized-Dark
and Solarized Light to Solarized-Light, to do so just open the setting on the windowsTerminal this should open the json file 
where you can make the suggested changes, the color themes are defined closer to the bottom of the json file.  If you just did a simple install the path should be the same(maybe) just change the user name to yours in the json file's path.  

Add the code on the bashrc file to your .bashrc file 
the command light will change the theme to Solarized Light
dark will do the same for Solarized Dark


## Additional info
F10 will run the command Light
F11 will run the command dark
