# windowsterminal
Changing the windows terminal colorscheme from the WSL command line.


The only changes I have made is renamed the Solarized Dark theme to Solarized-Dark
and Solarized Light to Solarized-Light

Add the code on the bashrc file to your .bashrc file 
the command light will change the theme to Solarized Light
dark will do the same for Solarized Dark


## Additional info
F10 will run the command Light
F11 will run the command dark
